## Brief
This final project is all yours. You may continue developing Project 1 or 2, or start something entirely new. Use this as an opportunity to explore an idea you’re excited about, refine an existing prototype, or finally make that personal website. You're welcome to build your project using WordPress, Cargo, Squarespace, or another platform—as long as you insert your own custom code (HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript) somewhere in the final result.

Although you'll present your project during the final week of class, you'll have a few extra days to submit the final version. I'll also be asking for some project details during Week 14. Keep an eye on your inbox for that email.

## Final Deliverables
**Due Week 14, May 1st**
- **Final Project:** A live site, shareable via URL. It must include some custom code. If using GitHub, instead of the repository link, please share your GitHub Pages URL.
- **Class Self-Reflection (500+ words):** Reflect on your experience in the class: what you learned, what you wish you had learned, what challenged, excited, or bored you. Talk through your term experience.
